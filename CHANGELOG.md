[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-07

First public release, the reference version behind the targeted
alpha-particle therapy validation with Astatine 211-ParaThanatrace published
in Onecha et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 123(3), 2025.

### Added
- Three documented, tested source modes: `uniform`, `invitro_bind`,
  `activity_map`.
- `patches/` - the two small upstream fixes (OpenTOPAS, Geant4) this build
  needs, neither released yet.
- CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`): builds Geant4 11.2.2 and OpenTOPAS 4.2.3
  from source with the two patches applied, links this extension against
  them, and runs the full regression suite on every push and pull request.
- Regression suite covering legacy parity, determinism, chain-control
  contracts, metadata schema, and the `activity_map` DICOM contract.
